## Style guides: Markdown's approach to best practices

There is no single set of best practices for using Markdown. Though many communities have tried to standardize best practices through the creation of style guides, Markdown creater John Gruber has not created or endorsed a specific guide. This vision for Markdown allows it to be flexible for many types of users.

## When to choose a style guide

Nevertheless, using a standardized Markdown makes it significantly easier to maintain uniformity within a company or project. To this point, Google has an [open source style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html), and several websites have adopted a more standardized specification of Markdown called [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), including [Github](https://github.com/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). There are also a variety of [linters](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/main/docs/RULES.md#rules) which, much like spellcheck, will identify and fix Markdown errors for you so that you don't have to memorize hundreds of syntax rules.

The following situations support choosing a style guide appropriate for your situation:

 * Your product is documentation

 * Your company employs a large team with many contributors to documents

 * You are contributing to an open-source project
