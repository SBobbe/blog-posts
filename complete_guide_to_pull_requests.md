### Before you begin

When opening a pull request to a new open source project, read through their documentation to find any instructions or requests 

### Quick method

1. Find an open source project you would like to contribute to and read through the documentation to become familiar with their style. Make note of anything you think should be fixed (think grammatical errors, unclear language, or broken links).
1. Look for a README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md document and read it to ensure you understand the guidelines for contributing to the project.
1. Once you have found a document you'd like to edit, go to the docs on github. There may be a link that says "edit this page on github." 
2. Click the pencil in the top right-hand corner to "fork this repo and edit the file"
3. Make your changes, following any instructions from the project's README or CONTRIBUTING docs.
4. Write a commit message and description, which should be clear and concise for the project's docs reviewer. 
5. Click "Propose Changes"
6. Create your Pull Request
