## Vocabulary and getting your bearings

* _Open-source project_: a project in which the source code and documentation are made publicly available, allowing anyone to view or contribute to it.
* _Pull request_: A request made by a contributer to merge changes from one branch into another.
* _Filing an issue_: Notifying a team of a bug or error, or suggesting an improvement using a project's issue tracker (such as Github).
* _UX_: User experience or satisfaction--in this case, the user is often the docs reader.
