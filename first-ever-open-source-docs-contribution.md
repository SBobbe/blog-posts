# Preparing for your first open source documentation contribution

Learning how to contribute to an open source project is a great way to learn more about documentation and gain experience and confidence in the docs world. Sarah Rainsberger, Docs Lead at [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/), demystifies the docs process and advises how to make your very first open source documentation contribution. This blog post condenses her presentation for easy reference, but the video is well worth a watch!

## Vocabulary and getting your bearings

* _Open-source project_: a project in which the source code and documentation are made publicly available, allowing anyone to view or contribute to it.
* _Pull request (PR)_: A request made by a contributer to merge changes from one branch into another.
* _Filing an issue_: Notifying a team of a bug or error, or suggesting an improvement using a project's issue tracker (such as Github).
* _UX_: User experience or satisfaction--in this case, the user is often the docs reader.

## Finding your first open-source project

There are many open-source projects out there in addition to Astro. Look for a project that has easily accessible documentation, including getting-started guides or tutorials.

### Choosing your first issue

The easiest way to make your first contribution is to identify your chosen project's needs. Ask yourself who your contribution is helping, and what it is helping them to do. Rainsberger gives the example that identifying and fixing a typo improves the reader's experience.

It's also worth familiarizing yourself with the project's **community support questions.**. Answering a question in the community by providing a link to existing documentation is a great way to build trust that you'd like to help the community. As you become more familiar with the project, notice any questions that cannot easily be answered with a link to a document. Once you're sure you've identified such a question, you could file an issue to bring it to a docs manager's attention and give input for any new documentation.
