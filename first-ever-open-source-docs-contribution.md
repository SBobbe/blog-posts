# Preparing for your first open source documentation contribution

Learning how to contribute to an open source project is a great way to learn more about documentation and gain experience and confidence in the docs world. Sarah Rainsberger, Docs Lead at [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/), demystifies the docs process and advises how to make your very first open source documentation contribution. This blog post condenses her presentation for easy reference, but the video is well worth a watch!

## Vocabulary and getting your bearings

* _Open-source project_: a project in which the source code and documentation are made publicly available, allowing anyone to view or contribute to it.
* _Pull request (PR)_: A request made by a contributer to merge changes from one branch into another.
* _Filing an issue_: Notifying a team of a bug or error, or suggesting an improvement using a project's issue tracker (such as Github).
* _UX_: User experience or satisfaction--in this case, the user is often the docs reader.

## Finding your first open-source project

There are many open-source projects out there in addition to Astro. Look for a project that has easily accessible documentation, including getting-started guides or tutorials.

### Choosing your first issue

The easiest way to make your first contribution is to identify your chosen project's needs. Ask yourself who your contribution is helping, and what it is helping them to do. Rainsberger gives the example that identifying and fixing a typo improves the reader's experience.

It's also worth familiarizing yourself with the project's **community support questions.**. Answering a question in the community by providing a link to existing documentation is a great way to build trust that you'd like to help the community. As you become more familiar with the project, notice any questions that cannot easily be answered with a link to a document. Once you're sure you've identified such a question, you could file an issue to bring it to a docs manager's attention and give input for any new documentation.

## Common mistakes

Like any newcomer, you may encounter pitfalls, such as rejected pull requests, in the beginning of your open-source documentation journey. If your PRs keep getting rejected, ask yourself:

* _"Did I make a big content change?"_ Remember that documentation specialists receiving pull requests have lots of work to do, and it takes time to review and edit large chunks of text.
  * __Fix it by__: making more, smaller pull requests so that new changes can be accepted or rejected on a case-by-case basis.
* _"Am I addressing a pain point?"_ If your contribution does not address something that is widely accepted as a problem, it may be rejected because your new content is not necessarily better than what already exists. Rainsberger calls this "low quality helping." If you have lots of thoughts on a topic, feel free to write a blog post about it instead!
  * __Fix it by__: looking through your project's documentation for files that list known problems that need fixing instead of trying to identify problems by yourself.
* _"Is my contribution too niche?"_ If your contribution addresses a problem that very few users will encounter or seeks to highlight a feature that does not have many use cases, your pull request may be rejected to avoid confusing users.
  * __Fix it by__: referring to your project's documentation for a list of problems to work on that will impact a greater number of users if solved. Remember, you can always file an issue to ask about the topic before putting in the work to create new documentation.
* _"Are my instructions linear?"_ If you have accidentally included a step in your instructions that must have been taken earlier in order to be successful, your documentation is creating friction for the UX.
  * **Fix it by**: reviewing your writing to ensure that your instructions are chronologically accurate and comprehensive.
